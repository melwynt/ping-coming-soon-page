## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SASS/SCSS - For styles

### What I learned

For this project I reused the `email validation`logic built in another project ([github.com/melwynt/intro-component-with-signup-form-master](https://github.com/melwynt/intro-component-with-signup-form-master))

### Continued development

- Fix the design of the error message to match provided mobile design
- Change Facebook icon with LinkedIn icon
- Add social links
- Add success/thank you message once email is sent

### Useful resources

For this project I used this boilerplate which is saving me tons of time:<br>

- [github.com/melwynt/react-html-sass-boilerplate](https://github.com/melwynt/react-html-sass-boilerplate)

It's a simple React and SASS Boilerplate with Parcel bundler.

- [Pixel Perfect Pro](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/pixel-perfect-pro/) - This helped me to display a screenshot on top of the webpage to easily check if dimensions were accurate. This is super useful is you need to create pixel perfect work.
- [PX: Viewport Dimensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/px-viewport-dimensions/) - This add-on will show you the dimensions of your viewport while resizing your browser.

Other tools:

- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) - This helped me resize screenshots provided in the project
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com) - This helped me create a rapid mockup to get dimensions of components.
